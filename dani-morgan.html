She also completed her higher education at Florida State University, where she received a bachelor’s degree in Sport Management, and was admitted into the Master of Human Resource Management program at the University of South Carolina.

She opted to return to Florida State for her fifth and final season in 2021 after the NCAA announcement. She has ambitions for her Seminoles in the upcoming season.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p><strong>Dani Morgan stands 5 ft 8 inches tall and weighs 57 kg.</strong> Furthermore, She has Blonde hair and Hazel eyes.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>For her gameplay and amazing looks, the athlete is well-known on the ground as well as on social media.
