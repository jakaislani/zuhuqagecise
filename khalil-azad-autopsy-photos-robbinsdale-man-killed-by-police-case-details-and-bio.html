Now, startling new information about the case has left many stunned and incensed.</p><p>Robbinsdale, Minnesota residents and family are questioning and pleading with the local police enforcement to accept responsibility for Khalil Azad’s demise.</p><p>Khalil’s corpse was discovered on Thursday night in Crystal Lake, Robbinsdale, where a candlelight vigil was held from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.</p><h2><span id=Photos_of_Khalil_Azad8217s_autopsy_Man_from_Robbinsdale_Killed_by_Police>Photos of Khalil Azad’s autopsy Man from Robbinsdale Killed by Police</span></h2><p>Khalil Azad was stopped by the Robbinsdale Police Department on July 2, 2022. At a traffic check, he ran from the policemen and into the Crystal Lake forests.</p><p>Azad was unarmed, but he had a warrant and had been the victim of abuse by the Robbinsdale Police Department in the past. Numerous police officers and groups of K-9s pursued Khalil. The destitute guy fled for his life.</p><p>But on July 5, 2022, three days later, a homeless man discovered the lifeless corpse floating upside down along the beaches of Crystal Lake.</p><p>After examining the corpse later that day, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office determined that the deceased was Khalil Azad.</p><p>Subsequently, the examiner noted that freshwater drowning was the cause of death. But autopsy images of Khalil Azad seem to indicate otherwise.</p><h2><span id=Details_about_Khalil_Azad8217s_case>Details about Khalil Azad’s case</span></h2><p>Autopsy images of Khalil Azad revealed his horrific appearance and the extent of police abuse.</p><p>His face and torso are covered with severe bruises, according to the autopsy records. The autopsy photos showed the victim’s remains in a severely degraded state.</p><p>Khalil has totally broken his nose and back, and his jaws are dislocated. The photographs moreover show his dreadlocks torn off his head, encompassing his eyes.</p><p>The relatives of the victim came to the conclusion that the medical examination findings were falsified since Khalil was able to swim and, more crucially, because a guy of six feet could never drown in two feet of shallow water.</p><p>People are drawing comparisons between this occurrence and the BLM Minnesota activists Tyree Nichols, Rodney King, and Emit Till, as well as a number of other innumerable victims who were tortured by the police in the United States.</p><p>The community of BLM, Minnesota, is requesting the release of all body-cam video as well as the charges brought against the police and medical examiners that led to Khalil Azad’s demise.</p><h2><span id=Khalil_Azad_Who_Was_He_Bio_and_Age>Khalil Azad: Who Was He? Bio and Age</span></h2><p>When Khalil Azad was twenty-four years old, he lived in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, with his parents and other family members. Kai’lani Queen Azad is the daughter he also left behind.</p><p>After viewing the photos, several individuals posted them on social media. This also applies to her spouse, Montress Azad.</p><p>“The police brutality beat my baby’s father Khalil Azad and threw him in the river,” said Montress, taking over Instagram. Their daughter’s father passed away when she was just two months old.</p><p>The death of their son has left the Azad family devastated, and they are afraid of the authorities. In addition, they want inquiries and prosecutions conducted inside the Robbinsdale medical examiner’s office and police department. Teen activists in Minnesota are also standing with the Azad family.</p><p>In addition, they want the suspension of K-9 police dogs and the release of dashcam video.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1350209,"3":{"1":0},"9":0,"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"15":"Arial","18":1,"21":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/"}{"1":65}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>police enforcement to accept responsibility</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>What Does Kevin Durant Get Paid Per Year</a></h3>American professional basketball player Kevin Wayne Durant, better known by his initials KD, plays for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association.
