He had an older brother, Michael (1942–2012), and a sister, Mary Jane Elizabeth. In 2006 Bryson published The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, a humorous account of his childhood years in Des Moines.</p><p>He attended Drake University for two years before dropping out in 1972, deciding instead to backpack around Europe for four months. He returned to Europe the following year with a high-school friend, Matt Angerer (the pseudonymous Stephen Katz).

He lives in Hanover, New Hampshire, with his wife and his four children.</p><p>Bill’s books and lectures demonstrate an abiding love for science and an appreciation for its social importance.

In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves.</p><p>Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, traveling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps.</p><p>He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-home></span>Bill Bryson Home<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-special-guest-on-this-weeks-home-delivery></span>Bill Bryson special guest on this week’s Home Delivery<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>American born writer Bill Bryson came to prominence with his recollections of living in the UK Notes from a Small Island.

It was published in May 2010. The book covers topics of the commerce, architecture, technology, and geography that have shaped homes into what they are today told through a series of “tours” through Bryson’s Norfolk rectory that quickly digress into the history of each particular room.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-australia-bill-bryson-on-australia-bill-bryson-australia-book-bill-bryson-down-under></span>Bill Bryson Australia | Bill Bryson On Australia | Bill Bryson Australia Book | Bill Bryson Down Under<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=down-under-book></span>Down Under (book)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Down Under is the British title of a 2000 travelogue book about Australia written by best-selling travel writer Bill Bryson. In the United States and Canada, it was published titled In a Sunburned Country, a title taken from the famous Australian poem, “My Country”. It was also published as part of Walk About, which included Down Under and another of Bryson’s books, A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, in one volume.</p><p>Bill Bryson describes his travels by railway and car throughout Australia, his conversations with people in all walks of life about the history, geography, unusual plants and animals of the country, and his wry impressions of the life, culture, and amenities (or lack thereof) in each locality.</p><p>In a style similar to his book A Walk in the Woods, or William Least Heat-Moon’s Blue Highways, Bryson’s research enabled him to include many stories about Australia’s 19th-century explorers and settlers who suffered extreme deprivations, as well as details about its natural resources, culture, and economy. His writings are intertwined with recurring humorous themes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-net-worth></span>Bill Bryson Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bill Bryson is an American author, he has an estimated Net Worth of $10 million dollars as of 2019. he has resided in Britain for much of his adult life and served as chancellor of Durham University from 2005 to 2011. Bryson authors books on travel, the English language, science, and more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-one-summer-bill-bryson-1927-bill-bryson-one-summer-america-1927></span>Bill Bryson One Summer | Bill Bryson 1927 | Bill Bryson One Summer America 1927<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One Summer: America, 1927 is a 2013 history book by Bill Bryson. The book is a history of the summer of 1927 in the United States. It was published in October 2013 by Doubleday. The book focuses on various key events of that summer as lenses through which to view American life: what it had recently been and what it was becoming.</p><p>The events covered include the nonstop transatlantic flight of Charles Lindbergh; the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927; the unusual season played by Babe Ruth and the rest of the 1927 New York Yankees; the transition from the Ford Model T to the new Model A; the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti; the presidency of Calvin Coolidge; and the advent of the talking-picture era with the release of The Jazz Singer.</p><p>One of the themes explored is the contrast between the Roaring Twenties of the time and the looming Great Depression. For example, the rapid rise and equally rapid fall of the business empire of the Van Sweringen brothers is discussed, with its glimpses of future suburbia (at Shaker Heights, Ohio) and future shopping malls (at Union Terminal), as well as the brothers’ eventual death in poverty.</p><p>Also briefly discussed is the rise and fall of Charles Ponzi’s postal coupon business, the original Ponzi scheme. The primary focus of the book, however, is on daily life, and popular culture during that summer, such as daredevil flying, the party life of sports stars, the habits of eccentric geniuses, and what people did during hot times when air conditioning was unknown except as a scarce luxury at a few theaters and hotels.</p><p>The focus on a particular moment in history as a means to explore the wider world parallels Bryson’s previous book, 2010’s At Home: A Short History of Private Life, which used a particular place on Earth (a parson’s house in England) as a home base from which to explore a broader subject. Both books note a singular coalescence of coincidences or turning points in a particular year (At Home, 1851; One Summer, 1927).</p><p>These location-centered and timepoint-centered approaches offer a contrast to 2003’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, which used a diametrically opposite approach, sweeping widely across time, distance, and scale. All of the books share the common theme that they help the reader to understand life and the universe as integrated wholes and yet simultaneously as variegated collections of details.</p><p>Bryson does not address himself solely to American readers. For example, Babe Ruth and baseball are a major topic of the book, and Bryson gives useful explanations of this American game and its terminology.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-mother-tongue-bill-bryson-mother-tongue-pdf></span>Bill Bryson Mother Tongue | Bill Bryson Mother Tongue Pdf<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Mother Tongue is a book by Bill Bryson which compiles the history and origins of the English language and its various quirks. It is subtitled English And How It Got That Way.</p><p>The book discusses the Indo-European origins of English, the growing status of English as a global language, the complex etymology of English words, the dialects of English, spelling reform, prescriptive grammar, and more minor topics including swearing. This account popularises the subject and makes it accessible to the lay reader, but it has been criticised for some inaccuracies, such as the perpetuation of several urban myths.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-new-book-bill-bryson-the-body-bill-bryson-latest-book-bill-bryson-website></span>Bill Bryson New Book | Bill Bryson The Body | Bill Bryson Latest Book |Bill Bryson Website<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-body-a-guide-for-occupants></span>The Body: A Guide for Occupants<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bill Bryson once again proves himself to be an incomparable companion as he guides us through the human body–how it functions, its remarkable ability to heal itself, and (unfortunately) the ways it can fail.</p><p>Full of extraordinary facts (your body made a million red blood cells since you started reading this) and irresistible Bryson-Esque anecdotes, The Body will lead you to a deeper understanding of the miracle that is life in general and you in particular.</p><p>As Bill Bryson writes, “We pass our existence within this wobble of flesh and yet take it almost entirely for granted.” The Body will cure that indifference with generous doses of wondrous, compulsively readable facts and information.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-shakespeare></span>Bill Bryson Shakespeare<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Shakespeare: The World as Stage</strong> is a biography of William Shakespeare by author Bill Bryson. The 199-page book is part of Harper Collins’ series of biographies, “Eminent Lives”.</p><p>The focus of the book is to state what little is known conclusively about Shakespeare, and how this information is known, with some discussion of disproved theories, myths, and that which is believed by the public but not provable. It also explores the political, social, cultural and economic background to Shakespeare’s work.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-made-in-america-bill-bryson-history-bill-bryson-a-short-history></span>Bill Bryson Made In America | Bill Bryson History | Bill Bryson A Short History<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Made In America is a nonfiction book by Bill Bryson describing the history of the English language in the United States and the evolution of American culture.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-in-a-sunburned-country-bill-bryson-sunburned-country></span>Bill Bryson In A Sunburned Country | Bill Bryson Sunburned Country<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Every time Bill Bryson walks out the door, memorable travel literature threatens to break out. His previous excursion along the Appalachian Trail resulted in the sublime national bestseller A Walk in the Woods.</p><p>In A Sunburned Country is his report on what he found in an entirely different place: Australia, the country that doubles as a continent, and a place with the friendliest inhabitants, the hottest, driest weather, and the most peculiar and lethal wildlife to be found on the planet. The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiosity.</p><p>Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path.</p><p>Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book. Australia is an immense and fortunate land, and it has found in Bill Bryson its perfect guide.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-lost-continent-bill-bryson-the-lost-continent></span>Bill Bryson Lost Continent | Bill Bryson The Lost Continent<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America is a book by travel writer Bill Bryson, chronicling his 13,978 mile trip around the United States in the autumn of 1987 and spring 1988. It was Bryson’s first travel book.</p><p>He begins his journey, made almost entirely by car, in his childhood hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, heading from there towards the Mississippi River, often reminiscing about his childhood in Iowa. The journey was made after his father’s death, and so is in part a collection of memories of his father in Des Moines while he was growing up.</p><p>The book is split into two sections: ‘East’ and ‘West’, the former part being considerably longer than the latter. These sections correspond to two separate journeys made in the autumn of 1987 and the spring of 1988. The first section covers the Midwest, the Deep South, the East Coast, and New England, before returning to Des Moines. The second section focuses on the Great Plains, the South West, California and the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>Bryson’s goal in this trip was generally to avoid tourist destinations, instead choosing to experience the real every-day America, stopping at small towns and forgotten points of interest. This book is an overview of the United States from Bryson’s point of view. There is less focus on factual insight into the history, geography, and culture of the destinations in this book than is found in some of Bryson’s later books, focusing instead on observations made with the intention of being humorous.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-twitter></span>Bill Bryson Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-quotes-bill-bryson-walk-in-the-woods-quotes></span>Bill Bryson Quotes | Bill Bryson Walk In The Woods Quotes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>I come from Des Moines.

Notwithstanding the tricky geographic challenge of Bryson having resided in England since 2003, that appellation surely fits Bill Bryson.</p><p>Reading a Bryson book is always a pleasure. In the case of The Body and some other Bryson books (but not all), the author narrates his own text. Hearing Bryson read his work aloud is truly a delight.</p><p>Each time I read a Bill Bryson book, I smile to think that for some years of his life (1995 to 2003) in the college town that I now work and reside. We missed each other by three years, which makes me sad, as I would have taken Bryson to Lou’s for breakfast to talk about his books. The fact that Bryson chose to live in Hanover, N.H., without any affiliation to the town’s small local college, speaks highly about the quality of life on offer in small college towns.</p><p>The Body is typical Bryson, in that the book is jam-packed with ideas and facts and trivia. Recent Bryson books, most notably The Body, A Short History of Nearly Everything and At Home: A Short History of Private Life, read something like facts set to music. The amount of data that Bryson can cram into his books is impressive, made more so by the fact that his books are not especially concise. The Body comes in at 464 pages, or 14 hours and four minutes.</p><p>While reading The Body (switching between my eyes and my ears), I did feel as if I was getting very smart indeed. Bryson finds something that is counterintuitively fascinating about every bodily system, organ and process. He not only explains how the body works, but what can go wrong and why.</p><p>The challenge in reading The Body lies less with the author, but the reader. You will get much more out of The Body if you come to read the book with greater anatomical and medical knowledge than a sociologist.</p><p>While reading The Body, I tried to make a point of stopping and sharing whatever surprising medical tidbit or fact that Bryson was sharing with my medical doctor’s wife. What was big news to me (can you explain what the pancreas really does, or how the heart actually works), was super obvious to her. The irony is that as an academic physician, my wife lacks the time to read The Body, although she would likely get far more out of the book in terms of retention than I did.</p><p>Where The Body should be liberally handed out is among medical students. I have no idea if there is a tradition to hand out books the summer before first-year med students arrive on campus. If that tradition exists, The Body would be an excellent selection.</p><p>The sections of The Body where I did retain the information presented were on the failings of the U.S. health-care system. We might know how little we get for how much we spend in the U.S. on health care, but reading about how badly we fare in outcomes such as maternal and childhood mortality is genuinely depressing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-neither-here-nor-there></span>Bill Bryson Neither Here Nor There<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=neither-here-nor-there-travels-in-europe></span>Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe is a 1991 humorous travelogue by American writer Bill Bryson. It documents the author’s tour of Europe in 1990, with many flashbacks to two summer tours he made in 1972 and 1973 in his college days.</p><p>Parts featuring his 1973 tour focus to a large extent on the pseudonymous “Stephen Katz”, who accompanied Bryson, and who would play a more prominent role in Bryson’s later book A Walk in the Woods, as well as appearing in The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid.</p><p>Bryson’s trip begins in the winter, in Hammerfest, Norway, where his goal is to see the Northern Lights. He visits numerous locations throughout Europe, commenting on the various aspects of life in different parts of Europe, and comparing them to how he experienced them in his earlier visits. The book ends with Bryson reaching Istanbul, Turkey, and contemplating on how the city is the gateway to Asia and considers continuing his tour.</p><p>Unlike Bryson’s later books, Neither Here nor There is marked by his solo observations; he does not seem to engage locals in conversation in his travels, nor is there as much detailed research about the history, flora, and fauna of the places visited.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-notes-from-a-small-island></span>Bill Bryson Notes From A Small Island<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Notes from a Small Island is a humorous travel book on Great Britain by American author Bill Bryson, first published in 1995. He wrote Notes from a Small Island when he decided to move back to his native United States, but wanted to take one final trip around Great Britain, which had been his home for over twenty years.</p><p>Bryson covers all corners of the island, observing and talking to people from as far afield as Exeter in the West Country to John o’ Groats at the north-eastern tip of Scotland’s mainland. During this trip he insisted on using only public transport but failed on two occasions: in Oxfordshire and on the journey to John o’ Groats he had to rent a car. He also re-visits Virginia Water where he worked at the Holloway Sanatorium when he first came to Britain in 1973. (He met his future wife while employed at Holloway.)</p><p>On his way, Bryson provides historical information on the places he visits, and expresses amazement at the heritage in Britain, stating that there were 445,000 listed historical buildings, 12,000 medieval churches, 1,500,000 acres (610,000 ha) of common land, 120,000 miles (190,000 km) of footpaths and public rights-of-way, 600,000 known sites of archaeological interest and that in his Yorkshire village at that time, there were more 17th century buildings than in the whole of North America.</p><p>Bryson also pays homage to the humble self-effacing fortitude of British people under trying times, such as the world wars and Great Depression, as well as the various peculiarities of Britain and British English (such as not understanding, on his first arrival, what a counterpane was, and assuming it was something to do with a window.</p><p>It is a British English word that means quilt.) Bryson also recalls first going into an English tobacconist’s and hearing the man in front of him ask for “Twenty Number 6”, and assuming that everything in Britain was ordered by number. (A popular brand at the time was Players No. 6, and in British English, it is usual to ask for ‘twenty’ (cigarettes), meaning a packet, not twenty of them.)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-movie></span>Bill Bryson Movie<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-walk-in-the-woods-film></span>A Walk in the Woods (film)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A Walk in the Woods is a 2015 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Ken Kwapis and starring Robert Redford, Nick Nolte, and Emma Thompson.

His travel books include “The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America”, “Down Under” about that quirky place Australia, “A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail”, “Bill Bryson’s African Diary” and “Notes from a Small Island”, which is a national poll was voted the book that best represents Britain, where the American has chosen to live for much of his adult life.</p><p>He has also written a biography of the shadowy Shakespeare, a couple of history books in “At Home: A Short History of Private Life” and “One Summer: America, 1927”, and a memoir about his own childhood following his birth in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1951 titled “The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid”.</p><p>Now, like a skilled surgeon, or a vivisectionist, Bryson has produced a second staunchly scientific book, “The Body. A Guide for Occupants”, carving up the corpus into its various components: the skin and hair, brain, head, mouth and throat, heart and blood, skeleton, nerves and pain, lungs and breathing, guts, immune system, the nether regions, etcetera.</p><p>Four years in the making, the book draws on dozens of experts and contains almost 30 pages listing the sources Bryson used and a 12-page bibliography of some 220 books that provided valuable research. He explains: “We spend our whole lives in one body and yet most of us have practically no idea how it works and what goes on inside it. The idea of the book is simply to try to understand the extraordinary contraption that is us. What I learned is that we are infinitely more complex and wondrous, and often more mysterious, than I had ever suspected. There really is no story more amazing than the story of us.”</p><p>We pass our experience within this warm wobble of flesh and yet take it almost for granted, Bryson says. How many among us know roughly where the spleen is or what it does? Or the difference between tendons and ligaments? Or what our lymph nodes are up to? How many times a day do you suppose you blink? Well, it’s 14,000, so many that your eyes are shut for a total of 23 minutes every waking day.</p><p>Your lungs, smoothed out, would cover a tennis court, and the airways within them would stretch from London to Moscow. The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around the Earth. Fifty-nine elements are needed to construct a human being. Six of them – carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium and phosphorous – account for 99.1 percent of what makes us.</p><p>The body, Bryson tells us, is “a universe of mystery”. A very large part of what happens on and within it happens for reasons that we don’t know – very often, no doubt because there are no reasons, he says. For instance, in describing the workings of the eye, the cornea “as with almost every part of the body, it is a wonder of complexity”. Tears come in three varieties: basal (for lubrication), reflex (against irritation such as smoke or onions) and emotional – we are the only creatures that cry from feeling, as far as we can tell, though why we do so is another of life’s many puzzles.</p><p>Bryson gives us the history of fingerprints, antiseptic surgery, the development of insulin, penicillin and intrauterine devices, and of open-heart surgery, lobotomies and kidney transplants. He weaves in stories of the astonishing characters who have been figuring out humans.</p><p>For instance, in the 1930s John H. Gibson sought to oxygenate blood to make open-heart surgery possible. “To test the capacity of blood vessels deep within the body to dilate or constrict, Gibbon stuck a thermometer up his rectum, swallowed a stomach tube. And then had icy water poured down it to determine its effect on his internal body temperature.”</p><p>There are myriad examples of medicine gone wrong. United States Founding Father and esteemed surgeon Benjamin Rush, during a yellow fever epidemic, “bled hundreds of victims and was convinced that he had saved a great many when in fact all he did was fail to kill them all. Part of the problem”, Bryson explains, “was that he believed that the body contains about twice as much blood as it actually does and that one can remove up to 80% of that notional amount without ill effect”.</p><p>The reader is carried from outside to inside from up to down and from miraculous operational efficiencies to malignant mayhem when things go awry. Cancer, as one expert opines, “is the price we pay for evolution. If our cells couldn’t mutate, we would never get cancer, but we also couldn’t evolve”. There are more than 200 cancers, and age is usually a major factor, with an 80-year-old 1000 times as likely as a teenager to get it.</p><p>The brain holds “200 exabytes of information, roughly equal to the entire digital content of today’s world”. The heart beats some 3.5 billion times in a lifetime. The bones are “stronger than reinforced concrete, yet light enough to allow us to sprint”. The lungs process 4000 gallons of air a day.</p><p>“You are pretty seriously perforated with two to five million hair follicles and perhaps twice that number of sweat glands.” And you are “exquisitely fine-tuned” with nerve receptors to detect movement of 0.00001 millimeters.</p><p>You grow 25 feet (7.66 meters) of hair in a lifetime. You host 40,000 species of microbes and when you kiss you transfer some 1 billion bacteria to your beloved, an action thought to be helpful in sampling the partner’s histocompatibility genes involved in the immune response.</p><p>In a lifetime you eat 60 tonnes of food, extracting the nutritional necessities and then producing seven tonnes of you-know-what. We produce enough flatulence that before laparoscopic insertion of carbon dioxide became the norm, patients undergoing anal surgery sometimes literally exploded.</p><p>And so on and so on. Men, apparently, don’t think about sex every seven seconds but about 19 times a day, about the same rate as thinking about food. Sex acts average about nine minutes (“in Britain at least”) and men burn 100 calories during such an encounter, women 70. Older people have an increased risk of heart attack for three hours after coitus, though the risk “was similarly raised for shovelling snow, and sex is more fun than shovelling snow”.</p><p>Thus the brainy Bryson balancing act, presenting the finer points of flesh and bones but in a readable and diverting manner for the layman. And, at 386 pages with illustrations, the book doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-bryson-instagram></span>Bill Bryson Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqZoblurtGyqqimXZe2sHnAoJxmr5mbsm6wwK6eoayVp3qju86kqmaZpajBs63LophmmZ6ZerW0xGaZqJypZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./robert-pattinson-reveals-the-difficulties-of-shooting-with-batmans-cowl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Pattinson reveals the difficulties of shooting with Batmans cowl">&larr;
