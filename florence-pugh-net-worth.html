And that is fascinating.” – Florence Pugh</li><li>“I knew that her grief, her pain, her constant tightrope of avoiding emotions, it needed to be exactly how someone would deal with the scenario they were in. And I’ve never come close to feeling any of that.” – Florence Pugh</li><li>“In my life, I’ve never witnessed grief like that or seen someone go through that level of pain. To get it perfect, I knew, would be so exhilarating and the payoff would be a fantastic feeling — which it was.” – Florence Pugh</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmaGyr8DNnq6sZp%2BntHB%2Bj2tqaGliZH12e8WlpqudnpiybrzUoJ9mppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-mel-gibson-gay-sexuality-partner-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Mel Gibson Gay: Sexuality Partner And Dating History">&larr;
