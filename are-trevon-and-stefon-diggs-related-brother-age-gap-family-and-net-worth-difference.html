They push one another to greater heights.</strong></p><p>While Trevon Diggs is a cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys, Stefon Diggs is a wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills.</p><p>Stefon Diggs played college football at Maryland. In 2015 the Minnesota Vikings drafted him in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL Draft. On the other hand, his younger brother, Trevon Diggs, played for the University of Alabama football team.</p><p>In 2020 the Cowboys selected him in the second round of the NFL Draft. Let’s further explore their bond in today’s article.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-trevon-and-stefon-diggs-related></span>Are Trevon And Stefon Diggs Related?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Are Trevon And Stefon Diggs Related? The answer is Yes!</p><p>The Diggs brothers make one of the top sibling tandems in the NFL. Trevon is a younger brother of Stefon. Born on 29 November 1993, Stefon Diggs is 28 years old. Likewise, Trevon Diggs was born on 20 September 1998, which makes him 24 years old as of 2022. <span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>Thus, the athletic brothers have four years of age gap.</span></p><p>During an interview with ESPN in January 2022, Stefon said he feels like he raised Trevon, and he is his son. They grew up together, so the eldest, Diggs, holds his little brother close to his heart.</p><p>Thanks to their age difference, the Diggs brothers neither played against each other in their high school nor collegiate careers. They are yet to play against each other in a regular-season NFL game which may come in 2023 when the Bills are slated to host Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>According to The Cowboys Wire, the NFC East and AFC East teams are set to play one another in 2023. Thus, if the brothers stick with their current team, they will face each other in an NFL game.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> Are Taulia Tagovailoa And Tua Tagovailoa Related?

Their dad died of congestive heart failure in January 2008. As of 2015, their mom was an Amtrack train attendant.</p><p>In between Stefon and Trevon, their brother Mar’Sean/Darez Diggs was born in 1995. He played cornerback at UAB. The Diggs brothers also have older half-brother Aron Jr. and older half-sister Porsche.</p><p>After their Father died, the Diggs siblings’ mother raised them alone. While talking about his mom with NewsTribune in 2015, Stefon called Stephanie a superwoman. The mother-son duo share a close-knit bond.</p><p>While expressing his gratitude towards his mother, the eldest Diggs said his mother taught him so much along the way. Stephanie is also the biggest fan of his son. The athlete surprised his mom by making a 36-yard touchdown catch in late 2015 at Detroit.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=trevon-diggs-and-stefon-diggs-net-worth-difference></span>Trevon Diggs And Stefon Diggs Net Worth Difference<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stefon Diggs, the two-time Pro Bowl receiver, agreed with Buffalo Bills on a four-year, $96 million contract that will keep him on the team until after the 2027 season.</p><p>He might also get some incentives for accomplishing different milestones. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported the wide receiver would receive a $21.5 million signing bonus and $70 million in total guarantees as a part of his new deal.</p><p>Stefon started his professional career in 2015. He played for Minnesota Vikings from 2015 to 2019. Back then, the talented football player signed a four-year, $2.5 million deal with the team that included a guaranteed $227,000 signing bonus.</p><p>As a result, Stefon Diggs’ net worth must be a massive sum.</p><p>On the other hand, Trevon Diggs’ net also appears to be huge. In 2020, he signed a four-year, $6,320,907 contract with the Dallas Cowboys. His new deal also includes $2,157,024 signing bonus, $3,054,338 guaranteed. Moreover, the average annual salary for the cornerback is $1,580,227.</p><p>In 2022 alone, He will earn a base salary of $1,184,628 while carrying a cap hit of $1,723,884 and a dead cap value of $1,078,512.</p><p><strong>Also Read: About The Actor Jacob York’s Family</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmimnq1vsSvpqdlkaOxbr%2FTnp2opl2Ztqiz0mapnqSRqbKlecGrpq2glad6orPEZp6aqF2brq61y7JkmqaUYrumwIywpqusmGKxqrLFnqmeppOafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dateline-norman-lee-radder-death-cause-was-it-suicide-or-murder-marital-problems-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dateline: Norman Lee Radder Death Cause, Was It Suicide Or Murder?
