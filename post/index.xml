Makikisilong lang,
Magpapalipas ng ulan,
Kwentuhan lang ang katapat,
Pero mas masaya kung ilabas ang gitara.Refrain:
Bigyan ng ingay itong gabi,
Walang tahimik na sandali,
Tara na...
Umawit kasabay ng kanta.
Chorus:
Tuma-tambay at nagkakatitigan.
Alam naman nila kahit na di mag aminan.
Tuma-tambay at nagkaka-igihan.
Ito ang ating kwento.
Ituloy mo lang ang kwento at tayo'y gagawa ng kanta.
Ii
Tayo'y umawit pa,
Hanggang malimot ang ulan.
Damdamin ko'y ilalahad.</description></item><item><title>Bob Stoops</title><link>/bob-stoops.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bob-stoops.html</guid><description>Bob Stoops estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles &amp;amp; many more details have been updated below.
