Miraculously, the family escaped the blaze without injury."</p><p>According to the outlet, Todd confessed to the arson. He told investigators he had not been getting along with his mother and wanted to scare her.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On Crime">Read More On Crime</h2><p>He was then sentenced to 30 months' probation and 160 hours of community service after waiving his right to a jury trial and pleading guilty to arson.</p><p>Todd had three daughters with Teresa, and although their marriage was happy at first, the pair separated in 2001 after Teresa said she wanted a <a href=#>divorce</a>.</p><p>Todd then married Katrina Smith, and they lived in Rockford, <a href=#>Illinois</a>.</p><p>On October 23, 2012, Katrina went <a href=#>missing</a>, with Todd claiming she had failed to return after leaving their home on the evening of October 22.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>On November 9 of that year, Katrina's body was found in the Rock River by an off-duty firefighter, per ABC News.</p><p>An autopsy found that her cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/www-youtube-com-watch-v-853714994.jpg><p>On October 30, 2012, <a href=#>police</a> searched Todd’s house, taking his laptop computer and a baseball bat from the garage that appeared to contain blood.</p><p>On November 21, detectives were notified by the crime lab that traces of Katrina's <a href=#>DNA</a> were found on the bat.</p><p>Todd pleaded not guilty after he was arrested and charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of concealing a homicide, per the publication.</p><h2>When was Todd Smith convicted?</h2><p>Todd Smith was convicted of the first-degree murder of Katrina and related charges on January 25, 2017, per ABC News.</p><p>He was sentenced to 59 years in <a href=#>prison</a> on April 4, 2017.</p><h2>Where is Todd Smith now?</h2><p>Todd is now serving his 59-year prison sentence.</p><p>Per <a aria-label="WIFR 23 (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WIFR 23</a>, in 2017, he appealed his conviction, but it was denied.</p><p>According to ABC News, Paige Smith — Todd's eldest daughter from his first marriage — spoke to her father for the last time after his murder trial.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She said: "After the verdict, I did not go to see him, but I talked to him on the phone, and I asked him to tell me what happened, and he wouldn't, because he immediately planned on appealing and trying to start that whole process.</p><p>"So, I was like, 'OK. Even if you appeal, you're not going to win this. Just tell me the truth,' and he still wouldn't.  And I said, 'OK. You can either tell me the truth, or I won't be talking to you anymore, because I can't do this.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdpaIVxfZJvZq2nlJl6rK3Tq6CnmV2ouqrAx2akrqqUmr9uw8eeqZ5lnqTEcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carrie-cast-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Carrie' Cast: Where Are They Now?">&larr;
