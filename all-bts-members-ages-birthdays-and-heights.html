He started his musical journey at age 11 when he was introduced to lyricism after his schoolteacher introduced him to Eminem’s music. He began writing lyrics and chose the name “Ranch Randa” when he started rapping in the underground hip-hop scene as a middle school student. He later selected the name “Rap Monster” during his time as an idol trainee before he formally changed it to RM (Real Me) in 2017.

Initially known for his dance skills, J-Hope actually went on to win first place in a national dance competition in 2008. He later gained interest in singing and rapping, which prompted him to go for an idol audition. He chose the moniker J-Hope because he wanted to represent hope for his fans and the group.

He is known for his visual prowess and was scouted by SM Entertainment agency off the street when he was a junior high student. He eventually turned down the offer because he believed it was a scam. At the time, his dream was to be an actor and graduate with a degree in art and acting. Without any foundation in music, Jin was scouted by his current agency, Big Hit Entertainment, for his handsome face. Jin has released two solo songs titled “Awake” and “Abyss” and enjoys success performing with his bandmates.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Suga</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by SUGA of BTS 민윤기 (@agustd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=1034 data-current-count=1334 data-injectable=true>29-year-old Min Yoongi, popularly known as Suga and Agust D, was born on March 9, 1993 and is five feet, nine inches tall. He is a rapper, songwriter, and producer known for his creative input, not only BTS’ music, but that of other K-pop groups and soloists as well. His interest in rap was ignited after he heard the Stony Skunk song “Reggae Muffin” and decided to become a rapper after listening to the music of Epik High. At 13, he was already writing lyrics and working at a recording studio, where he was composing, arranging, rapping, and performing music. He joined the hip-hop group D-Town in 2010 and — under the moniker Gloss — produced some of their best tracks. He chose the stage name Suga after he signed under his current company. The name was suggested because of his pale complexion, which he was told looked “sweet like sugar.” He took on the pseudonym Agust D when he released his mixtape in 2016 and now has over 100 registered songs credited to him by the Korea Music Copyright Association.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Jimin</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JIMIN (@j.m)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=629 data-current-count=929 data-injectable=true>Park Jimin, popularly referred to as Jimin, is 26 years old.
