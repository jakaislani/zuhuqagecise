Colonel in the Australian Army. His maternal grandparents were English, and his father was of English and some Scottish descent. Rick spent his childhood on various army bases in Australia and Britain. As a teenager, he fronted many music bands, such as the "Jordy Boys", "Wakedy Wak", and "Zoot". The latter was his most successful, paving his way for future success as a musician. He came to the U.S. early 1970s, and recorded an album, Beginnings. It had one "major" hit - Speak to The Sky. After that came "Comic Book Heroes", which was marginally successful.</p><p>He learned to speak English with an American accent to further his acting career, after he lost his record label. While he waited for his big break, he signed a contract with Universal television, playing bit parts in shows such as The Six Million Dollar Man (1974) and The Rockford Files (1974). He also had a recurring role on the soap The Young and the Restless (1973). In the early 1980s, his luck changed as he signed to RCA Records and was then cast as "Dr. Noah Drake" on the soap General Hospital (1963). While he had released six albums in the 1970s, his 1980 break-through album "Working Class Dog" gave him the #1 single "Jessie's Girl". From the music and TV exposure, he became a teen idol. He continued to star on "GH" while touring and releasing "Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet", with the hit "Don't Talk To Strangers". Upon releasing his 3rd album with RCA-"Living In Oz" he quit "GH" and went back to his rock roots. "Living In Oz" is considered by many his finest (and hardest rock) album. He starred in the movie Hard to Hold (1984) in 1984 and released the soundtrack to it with the hit "Love Somebody", followed by "Don't Walk Away" and "Bop Til Ya Drop". His next album, "Tao", started his slow descent from rock star status. It was followed up in 1988 by "Rock Of Life" which was his 'moodiest' and least recognized album (by the public).</p><p>In 2015, Rick received positive notices playing <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>'s character's boyfriend in Ricki and the Flash (2015).<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeinrCsedKpqaKml5u2prjDZqWerF2svLPAx2ZpamlpaYI%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./237169-tugboat-is-the-greatest-wrestler-ever.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tugboat Is The Greatest Wrestler Ever">&larr;
