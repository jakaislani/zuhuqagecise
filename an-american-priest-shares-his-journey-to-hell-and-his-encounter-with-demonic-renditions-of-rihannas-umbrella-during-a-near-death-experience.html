Johnson mentioned that ‘my spirit left my physical body’ when he suffered the heart attack seven years ago.</p><p>Despite living his life as a man of God, he was surprised when he was denied entry into Heaven and instead plummeted down to hell. Johnson took to TikTok to recount his 2016 journey into the abyss, describing it as an experience he ‘wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.’</p><p>‘I thought I was going upward, because I thought that I had done so much good in this lifetime and helped so many people and made so many decisions that were Godly decisions,’ he said. ‘But as opposed to me going up, I went down. I went literally into the center of the Earth. That’s where Hell is.’&nbsp;</p><p>According to the pastor, he was subjected to cruel punishments in Hell, including being tormented with demonic renditions of Rihanna’s ‘Umbrella’ and Bobby McFerrin’s ‘Don’t Worry Be Happy’.&nbsp;</p><p>‘It just blew me away, it still baffles me to this day,’ Johnson expressed. ‘There was a section in Hell where music was playing. It was the same music we hear on the Earth, but opposed to entertainers singing it, demons were singing it.&nbsp;</p><p>‘While up here, you can listen to music to get over a breakup like ‘Don’t Worry Be Happy’ or ‘Umbrella’, but down there every lyric to every song is to torment you.’</p><p>Johnson believes his extraordinary experience should serve as a warning to those who choose to enjoy chart-topping songs instead of hymns and prayers. He also claimed to have seen the disturbing scene of a man being burned alive.&nbsp;</p><p>‘The things that I saw were indescribable, it makes me emotional,’ he said. ‘His eyes were bulging and worse than that, he was wearing chains on his neck… it was a demon holding the chain.’</p><p>After being resuscitated and brought back to reality, the pastor insists that his experience is evidence that popular music is a ploy by the underworld to control people before they pass on.&nbsp;</p><p>‘On Earth, a lot of the lyrics and music are inspired by demons,’ he insisted. ‘People come into contact with demons who give them lyrics for the purpose of controlling people on Earth.’&nbsp;</p><p>The pastor cautioned others on how to avoid a similar hellish fate, as he believes it is now clear to him why he was originally doomed.&nbsp;</p><p>‘The root of it is that although I did good and gave a lot to people, the thing that I had in my heart was unforgiveness towards people that have done me wrong,’ he explained. ‘That’s my experience with Hell, it is a real place. God doesn’t send people to Hell, people send themselves to Hell.’&nbsp;</p><p>Watch the video below…</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiYp2WRorKztcKapWaoop6ytMCMrJ%2BaqpWoeqm10mahqK2io7K6edOoZKGdnKF6orrDZp%2Biq12au6S71KernqpdrLa1tIydnKannp6wbr7Ep5uirJmku7R5zp9kq6GYlruvrdJmrKaaopq5ra2MnayroZ6ceqJ5zZ6Yq2WUmq61tIyer6mdop6yr6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./moto-x-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CPU Performance - Moto X Review">&larr;
